# vbox-lowkey

Tired of getting your attempting  to run software in a virtualbox VM, but getting it detected? Also running on linux host?

`vbox-lowkey` can make it more difficult for the software  running in the VM
to detect that you are running it in a VM.

### Usage - Linux
1. create vm
2. clone your VM just in case something goes wrong
3. `sh vbox-lowkey <vm name>` and wait until it finishes
4. profit

### Usage - Windows
1. create vm
2. clone your VM just in case something goes wrong
3. `.\vbox-lowkey.ps1 <vm name>` and wait until it finishes
4. profit
